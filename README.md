# Binary Lambda Calculus Playground

This crate defines a representation of Î»-calculus and
provides parsers and printers for it.  The aim of this module
is to enable experimentation with the binary encoding described
by John Tromp, see [BLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wikiary_combinatory_logic)
and [Diagrams](https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html)

This is mostly a playground for me to practice Rust
